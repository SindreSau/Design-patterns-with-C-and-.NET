# Gamma Categorization

Design patterns are typically split into so called Gamma Categorizations - named after one of the original authors of
the Gang of Four book, Erich Gamma. The three typical Gamma categorizations are:
## Creational patterns
- Dealing with the creation/construction of objects
- Can be explicit (using a constructor) or implicit (using Dependency Injection, Factory Method, etc.)
- Wholesale (creating a whole object) or piecewise (step by step, e.g. Builder)

## Structural patterns
- Concerned with the structure of classes and objects
  - how they compose to form larger structures, for example by using inheritance or interfaces


## Behavioral patterns

- They are all different; no single theme
- Concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects
